Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

It consists\nof classes to read, write, hash, and sign the xdr structures that are used in\n[stellar-core](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core). This is an\nimplementation in JavaScript that can be used on either Node.js or web browsers.\n\n- **[API Reference](https://stellar.github.io/js-stellar-base/)**\n\n> **Warning!** The Node version of this package uses the [`sodium-native`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sodium-native) package, a native implementation of [Ed25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/) in Node.js, as an [optional dependency](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#optionaldependencies).\n> This means that if for any reason installation of this package fails, `stellar-base` will fallback to the much slower implementation contained in [`tweetnacl`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tweetnacl).\n>\n> If you'd explicitly prefer **not** to install the `sodium-native` package, pass the appropriate flag to skip optional dependencies when installing this package (e.g. `--no-optional` if using `npm install` or `--without-optional` using `yarn install`).\n>\n> If you are using `stellar-base` in a browser you can ignore this. However, for production backend deployments you should most likely be using `sodium-native`.\n> If `sodium-native` is successfully installed and working,\n> `StellarBase.FastSigning` variable will be equal `true`. Otherwise it will be\n> `false`.\n\n## Quick start\n\nUsing yarn to include js-stellar-base in your own project:\n\n```shell\nyarn add @stellar/stellar-base\n```\n\nFor browsers, [use Bower to install it](#to-use-in-the-browser). It exports a\nvariable `StellarBase`. The example below assumes you have `stellar-base.js`\nrelative to your html file.\n\n```html\n<script src=\"stellar-base.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  console.log(StellarBase);\n</script>\n```\n\n## Install\n\n### To use as a module in a Node.js project\n\n1. Install it using yarn:\n\n```shell\nyarn add @stellar/stellar-base\n```\n\n2. require/import it in your JavaScript:\n\n```js\nvar StellarBase = require('@stellar/stellar-base');\n```\n\n### To self host for use in the browser\n\n1. Install it using [bower](http://bower.io):\n\n```shell\nbower install stellar-base\n```\n\n2. Include it in the browser:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"./bower_components/stellar-base/stellar-base.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  console.log(StellarBase);\n</script>\n```\n\nIf you don't want to use install Bower, you can copy built JS files from the\n[bower-js-stellar-base repo](https://github.com/stellar/bower-js-stellar-base).\n\n### To use the [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/stellar-base) hosted script in the browser\n\n1. Instruct the browser to fetch the library from\n   [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/stellar-base), a 3rd party service that\n   hosts js libraries:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/stellar-base/{version}/stellar-base.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  console.log(StellarBase);\n</script>\n```\n\nNote that this method relies using a third party to host the JS library. This\nmay not be entirely secure.\n\nMake sure that you are using the latest version number. They can be found on the\n[releases page in Github](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/releases).\n\n### To develop and test js-stellar-base itself\n\n1. Install Node 18.x\n\nWe support the oldest LTS release of Node, which is [currently 18.x](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/). Please likewise install and develop on Node 16 so you don't get surprised when your code works locally but breaks in CI.\n\nIf you work on several projects that use different Node versions, you might find helpful to install a NodeJS version manager:\n\n  - https://github.com/creationix/nvm\n  - https://github.com/wbyoung/avn\n  - https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf\n\n2. Install Yarn\n\nThis project uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to manages its dependencies. To install Yarn, follow the project instructions available at https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install.\n\n3. Clone the repo\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base.git\n```\n\n4. Install dependencies inside js-stellar-base folder\n\n```shell\ncd js-stellar-base\nyarn\n```\n\n5. Observe the project's code style\n\nWhile you're making changes, make sure to regularly run the linter to catch any\nlinting errors (in addition to making sure your text editor supports ESLint)\n\n```shell\nyarn lint\n```\n\nas well as fixing any formatting errors with\n\n```shell\nyarn fmt\n```\n\nIf you're working on a file not in `src`, limit your code to Node 6.16 ES! See\nwhat's supported here: https://node.green/. (Our npm library must support\nearlier versions of Node, so the tests need to run on those versions.)\n\n#### Updating XDR definitions\n\nXDR updates are complicated due to the fact that you need workarounds for bugs\nin the generator, formatter, or a namespace adjustment.\n\n1. Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed and running.\n2. Change the commit hash to the right version of [stellar-xdr](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-xdr) and add any filenames that might've been introduced.\n3. Run `make reset-xdr`\n4. Run `sed -ie s/\\\"/\\'/g types/{curr,next}.d.ts` to minimize the diff (the generator's formatter uses `\"` but the repo uses `'`).\n5. Move `xdr.Operation` into a hidden namespace to avoid conflicts with the SDK's `Operation`.\n6. Add generator workarounds:\n  * `type Hash = Opaque[]` is a necessary alias that doesn't get generated\n  * `Hyper`, `UnsignedHyper`, and `ScSpecEventV0` need their signatures\n    fixed because linting wants an `Array` instead of a naked `[]`.\n  * Some constants aren't generated correctly (e.g, Ctrl+F `SCSYMBOL_LIMIT` in `src/curr_generated.js`)\n7. Finally, make code adjustments related to the XDR (these are usually revealed by running the tests).\n\nAs an example PR to follow, [stellar-base#800](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/pull/800) has detailed steps for each part of the process.\n\n## Usage\n\nFor information on how to use js-stellar-base, take a look at the docs in the\n[docs folder](./docs).\n\n## Testing\n\nTo run all tests:\n\n```shell\nyarn test\n```\n\nTo run a specific set of tests:\n\n```shell\nyarn test:node\nyarn test:browser\n```\n\nTests are also run automatically in Github Actions for every master commit and\npull request.\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation for this repo lives inside the [docs folder](./docs).\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to\ncontribute to this project.\n\n## Publishing to npm\n\n```\nnpm version [<newversion> | major | minor | patch | premajor | preminor | prepatch | prerelease]\n```\n\nA new version will be published to npm **and** Bower by GitHub Actions.\n\nnpm >= 2.13.0 required.
